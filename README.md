     HOW TO USE THIS FILE

     This is your submission. Fill each section in as you finish the milestone
     it belongs to — don't leave it all to the end.

     Unit 3 asks for the first five sections. Unit 4 adds the five below them.
     Leave the unit 4 sections alone until then; they're here so you know
     what's coming.

     Everything is pasted as TEXT. No screenshots, no images, no video links.
     A typed block of output gets full credit; a picture of the same output
     gets none.

<!-- ═══════════════════════ UNIT 3 — THE BUILD ═══════════════════════ -->

## What This Does

<!-- Three or four sentences: what a user asks for, and what they get back. -->
This program allows the user to type in clothing items with descriptions about type, size, and price and get a listing of 
outfit items from its inventory which match those descriptions. The user can also ask for outfit suggestions by listing an clothing item and importing a list of their own clothing items. The program will return a listing the clothing articles and a cheery outfit description of 2 to 4 sentences long. 


---

## Tool Inventory

<!-- Four lines per tool. This is worth 2 points and it's the single most
     common place students lose them.

     "Returns a list" earns NOTHING. The description has to say what is IN
     the list.

     The empty case isn't optional either — it's the thing your loop branches
     on, and if you don't decide it here you'll discover it as a crash in
     Milestone 5. -->

### `search_listings`

- **What it does:** Searches the listings.json file for clothing items with optional size and price ceiling which match the descriptions within
- **Inputs:** `description` (string), `max_price` (float), `size` (string)
- **Returns:** A list of best matched first items
- **When it has nothing:** Returns empty list

### `suggest_outfit`

- **What it does:** Suggests one or two outfits based on the user’s input of their thrifted item
- **Inputs:** `new_item` (dictionary), `wardrobe` (dictionary)
- **Returns:** A non empty string with outfit suggestions
- **When it has nothing:** Returns a general styling advice

### `create_fit_card`

- **What it does:** Creates a short caption about the outfit
- **Inputs:** `outfit` (string), `new_item` (dictionary) 
- **Returns:** Two to four sentences of description of the outfit
- **When it has nothing:** Returns an explanation of why no outfit was returned and a suggestion of how to expand search results

---

## Planning Loop

<!-- Your branch rule, stated as a rule — the condition AND both paths — plus
     the file and function that holds it.

     Like this:
       "If search_listings returns an empty list, put a message in the session
        and stop. Otherwise take the first result and go to suggest_outfit."
        — agent.py::run_agent

     The grader checks your code against what you claim here, so the file and
     function have to be real. -->


**Branch rule:** In the case of search_listings returns an empty list, put a message in session["error"] telling the user to broaden price, size, or description and stop. Otherwise, take the first result as session["selected_item"] and go to suggest_outfit.

**Where it lives:** `agent.py::run_agent`

**How the query is parsed:** Regex extracts an optional size and maximum price; the remaining text is used as the listing description.

**What moves through the session:** <!-- which fields, in what order -->
In function order of first to last:
`query` - user input
`wardrobe` - user input
`parsed` - from the query
`search_results` - populated as the non-empty output of `search_listings` on the query
`error` - a branch result that gets populated when the results is empty
`selected_item` - first listing dictionary item of `search_results`
`outfit_suggestion` - the agent's description of the suggested outfit
`fit_card` - description combined from `outfit_suggestion` and `wardrobe`

---

## Sample Run

<!-- Two things go here.

     1. One FULL query and its output, pasted as text.
     2. Your three per-tool terminal tests — the command and what it printed. -->

**One full query**

```
$ python app.py ask 'big dinosaur costume under $10'     

  No listings matched those filters. Try broadening the description, removing the size, or increasing the maximum price.

```

**The three tools, tested one at a time**

```
$ python -c "from tools import search_listings; print(search_listings('graphic tee', max_price=30))"

```

```
$ python -c "from tools import suggest_outfit; from utils.data_loader import get_example_wardrobe, load_listings; print(suggest_outfit(load_listings()[0], get_example_wardrobe()))"
Here are two ways to style those vintage Levi's 501s using pieces you already own:

**Look 1: Off-Duty Cool**
*   **Top:** White ribbed tank top
*   **Outerwear:** Vintage black denim jacket 
*   **Shoes:** Chunky white sneakers
*   **Accessories:** Black crossbody bag

**Style Note:** A classic double-denim moment that feels effortlessly cool. The crisp white tank keeps it fresh for daytime, while the chunky sneakers and black crossbody add that relaxed, 90s off-dutymodel energy.

***

**Look 2: Edgy & Laid-Back**
*   **Top:** Oversized grey crewneck sweatshirt
*   **Shoes:** Black combat boots
*   **Accessories:** Brown leather belt

**Style Note:** High-low styling at its best. Tucking the heavy grey crewneck into the 501s with a brown belt grounds the look, and the black combat boots add a tough, utilitarian edge to the classic medium-wash denim.

```

```
$ python -c "from tools import create_fit_card; from utils.data_loader import load_listings; print(create_fit_card('jeans and black boots', load_listings()[0]))"   
Found these vintage Levi's 501s on Depop for $38 and they are officially my new personality. Honestly nothing beats this medium wash paired with beat-up black boots

```

## How I Used AI

<!-- Two specific moments. What you asked, what came back, what you changed.

     "I used Claude to help me code" is not enough.

     "I gave Claude my search_listings spec. It returned None on no match
     instead of an empty list, so I changed it" is the level we want. -->

**Moment 1**

- *What I asked for:* I used Claude to help implement fuzzy logic in the `search_listing`.   
- *What came back:* Claude was able to implement fuzzy logic but the result was formatted differently than what I expected
- *What I changed:* I made an additional ask to Claude to double check the size and the price formatting

**Moment 2**

- *What I asked for:* I asked Claude to make the `create_fit_card` function to generate 2 - 4 sentences of outfit suggestions.
- *What came back:* It generated the correction responses that was a bit too formal.
- *What I changed:* I asked it to use a casual tone instead.

## Run Log — Before

<!-- Five criteria, five tries each, in this exact format.

     Five, because your criteria are written out of five. Mark each try PASS
     or FAIL, count the passes, and read that count against your target — a
     row targeting 4 of 5 with three PASS cells is MISSED (3/5).

     `python run_eval.py --label before` runs everything and writes the table
     into results/. Paste it here and fill in the verdicts. -->

| Criterion | Target | Try 1 | Try 2 | Try 3 | Try 4 | Try 5 | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 2.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 3.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 4.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 5.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

**Real output from one try**, pasted as text, naming the file and function
that produced it:

## Verdicts and Diagnoses

<!-- MET or MISSED per criterion against LAST UNIT's target, plus a sentence on
     how you decided.

     Then, for every miss: which of the four places it happened — a tool, the
     loop's branch, the session, or the model's output — AND the mechanism.

     Not a diagnosis:  "The fit card was bad."
     A diagnosis:      "The fit card criterion missed on 2 of 5 items. Both had
                        an empty brand field. My prompt puts the brand in the
                        first sentence, so the card opened with a blank and read
                        like a fragment. The tool worked; the prompt assumed a
                        field that isn't always there."

     Look for a pattern. Three misses on the same tool is one problem, not
     three. -->

| # | Criterion | Target | Verdict | How I decided |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 |  |  |  |  |
| 2 |  |  |  |  |
| 3 |  |  |  |  |
| 4 |  |  |  |  |
| 5 |  |  |  |  |

**Diagnoses**

## Loop Trace

<!-- One full run, printed step by step, with the MCP call visible in it.

     `python app.py ask '...' --trace` once you've added the trace.step()
     calls in Milestone 2.

     Worth pasting BOTH the happy path and the empty-search path. The empty
     one should be visibly shorter, because it stops. If your two traces are
     the same length, your branch isn't working — and this is the fastest way
     anyone will ever find that out. -->

**Happy path**

```

```

**Empty search**

```

```

**On the MCP move:** <!-- what changed in your code, and whether anything
behaved differently afterwards. If the rewire didn't work, say exactly where it
broke — the error text and the last thing that worked. That earns the point in
full. -->



---

## The Improvement

<!-- What you changed, why your diagnosis pointed at it, and the after-run in
     the same table format. One change, measured properly.

     `python run_eval.py --label after` -->

**What I changed:**

**Which failure it was meant to fix:**

### Run Log — After

| Criterion | Target | Try 1 | Try 2 | Try 3 | Try 4 | Try 5 | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 2.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 3.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 4.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 5.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

**Did it help, and how do I know:**

<!-- If it made things worse, say that. Honestly reported, that earns full
     credit and is more interesting than one that worked. -->



---

## What's Still Broken

<!-- For each criterion still missed: what you'd do, and why you stopped where
     you did. "I ran out of time" is fine if it's true. Pretending nothing is
     left is not. -->
